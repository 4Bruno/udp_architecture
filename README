UDP client/server architecture for game programming.
Client windows
Server linux

This is a bare-bones implementation minimal external dependency

Goals:

 * learning udp/ip/sockets/congestion
 * learning cross-platform implementation
 * learning sync client/server/frames
 * implement communication protocol for the game
 * learning encryption
 * learning compression
 * learning how to debug programs over network
 * aws server


Current external libraries:
 * Murmurhash for client ip hash
